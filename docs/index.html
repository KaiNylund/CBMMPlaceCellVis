    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Place cells are neurons in the hippocampus that react when an animal is in a specific spot
      in its environment. How do these cells act in a moving animal, and what kinds of areas do
      they cover?
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="s2">
    <h2>Simple experiment</h2>
    <p>
      We have a rat on a 3.5m long track and are recording from 4 of its hippocampal neurons
      as it moves. These neurons are color coded and simulated from actual place cells recorded
      in the Wilson lab at MIT. Each time a cell spikes, we'll add a tick with its corresponding
      color on the strip plot at the rat's position.
      <br><br>
      <span class="center">(drag the rat to get started)</span>
    </p>
    <div class="slider-container">
      <input type="range" id="ms-1" min="0" max="3.5" value="1.75" step="any">
    </div>
    <div id="strip-container">

    </div>
    <p>
      What can you observe about where and how frequently different cells are spiking? To visualize
      these behaviors, let's plot the same spikes over four histograms:
    </p>
    <div id="bars-container">
      <svg class="cell1-bars"></svg>
      <svg class="cell2-bars"></svg>
      <svg class="cell3-bars"></svg>
      <svg class="cell4-bars"></svg>
    </div>
    <p>
      It's clear that these four cells spike based on some distribution around a preferred area!
      But can place cells account for all of the rat's movement, or just these distributions?
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="s3">
    <h2>Estimating position</h2>
    <p>
      To answer the previous question, let's repeat the same experiment and try to predict the
      rat's movement from the spiking behavior of its place cells. If the prediction is accurate,
      it implies that place cells can explain all of the rat's movement (at least on this simple 
      track).
    </p>
    <p>
      For our estimations, we'll use a maximum likelihood approach based on all the spikes that
      occurred in the last half-second and their cells' average firing rate at each position bin.
      We verify these predictions by plotting them against the rat's movement below:
    </p>
    <div class="slider-container">
      <input type="range" id="ms-2" min="0" max="3.5" value="1.75" step="any">
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <svg class="rat-pos"></svg>
    </div>
    <p>
      Were the predictions accurate? If not, where did they fail? What happens if we increase
      or decrease the number of cells we're considering for our predictions?

    <h2>Appendix</h2>
    <p> 
      All place field spiking data was collected by Hector Penagos in Matt Wilson's lab and made 
      available by the 
      <a href=https://cbmm.mit.edu/learning-hub/tools-datasets/decoding-hippocampal-place-cell-data target="_blank">
      Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines</a> (CBMM). Analyses are drawn from Daniel Zysman and
      Ellen Hildreth's MATLAB live script.

      Spikes are simulated from a list of average spike rates at each position bin according to
      a Poisson Process. For more details about Poisson spiking, see this 
      <a href=https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/poisson.pdf target="_blank">handout</a> by
      professor David Heeger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let \(x_i\) indicate that the rat is in position \(i\).<br> 
      Let \(s_1, \dots, s_n\) be the number of spikes from each of the \(n\) cells.<br> 
      Let \(f(k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}\) be the Poisson PMF.<br><br>

      Using an MLE approach, our prediction for the rat's position is
      \(\max_i\{L(x_i | s_1, \dots, s_n)\}\).

      We can compute the likelihood that the rat is in position \(i\) as follows:
      \begin{flalign*}
        L(x_i | s_1, \dots, s_n) &= \mathbb{P}(s_1, \dots, s_n | x_1) \\
        & = \mathbb{P}(s_1 | x_i)\mathbb{P}(s_2 | x_i)\dots \mathbb{P}(s_n | x_i) \\
        & = f(s_1;\text{expected # of spikes at } x_i)\dots \\ & ~~~~~f(s_n;\text{expected # of spikes at } x_i)
      \end{flalign*}
